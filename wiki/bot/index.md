# IRC Bots
## What is an IRC Bot?
An IRC bot is a set of scripts or a program that connects to IRC as a client, and so appears to other users as another user. IRC bots can perform many different functions from checking the weather to games like uno and werewolf. Notable bots include [eggdrop](/wiki/bot/eggdrop), [supybot](/wiki/bot/supybot), and [Limnoria](/wiki/bot/limnoria).

## IRC Botnets
IRC Botnets (not to be confused with botnets controlled by IRC) are used to keep claim to channels on networks with no services, such as efnet. Popular bots used to build IRC botnets include [eggdrop](/wiki/bot/eggdrop), [wraith](/wiki/bot/wraith) and [muhstik](/wiki/bot/muhstik). Even though muhstik is typically used to carry out malicious activities such as channel floods and take overs, it can also be used to defend a channel from being taken over.
