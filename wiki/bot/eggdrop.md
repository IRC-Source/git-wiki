# Eggdrop

Eggdrop is written in the C programming language and features interfaces for C modules and Tcl scripts that allow users to further bolster the functionality of the bot. A large number of Tcl scripts are available to expand the bot's functionality, most of them written by Eggdrop users.

A notable Tcl script is 'bmotion' available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/jamesoff/bmotion)
