# HexChat IRC Client
**HexChat** is an IRC client based on XChat, but unlike XChat itâ€™s completely free for both Windows and Unix-like systems.

# Scripting
HexChat can be extended with scripts written in Lua, Perl, or Python. You can also load dynamic libraries which can extend HexChat's functionality.
