# IRC Clients
There are many **IRC clients** available for an array of different operating systems, as well as clients which are web based or inside of games.

Some IRC clients are extensible through scripts or libraries. For example, [mIRC](/wiki/client/mirc) can be extended by adding [mIRC scripts](/wiki/client/mirc#Scripting) or DLL plugins which are written and compiled for mIRC.

IRC clients on the web such as [IRCCloud](/wiki/client/irccloud), [KiwiIRC](/wiki/client/kiwiirc), and [Mibbit](/wiki/client/mibbit) will work on most web browsers. Ustream's chat interface is IRC with custom authentication as well as twitch.tv's.

Games such as War§ow, Unreal Tournament (>= Unreal Tournament 2004), Uplink, Spring Engine-based games, 0 A.D., ZDaemon and Gota.io have included IRC as a backend for their in game chat.
